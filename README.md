## üöÄ Lowcoder ‚ù§Ô∏è n8n

n8n is one of the world‚Äôs leading open-source automation tools. But automation needs a face.

**Lowcoder is the frontend builder your n8n flows deserve.**

- Turn workflows into real web apps, dashboards, forms, and portals
- Let users interact with your automations: fill forms, trigger workflows, view real-time status
- Use Lowcoder together with n8n via REST API, Webhooks, or our native [n8n-nodes-lowcoder](https://www.npmjs.com/package/n8n-nodes-lowcoder)
- We're working closely with the n8n team in Berlin for deeper native integration (stay tuned!)
